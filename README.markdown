# WebAssembly Build Suite

This repo contains complete builds of codebases compiled to WebAssembly. As
opposed to the spec test suite, which focuses on unit tests for specific
features, the builds here are of entire codebases, and are fully functional,
testing not just WebAssembly execution itself but also its integration to
the embedding web environment.
